## Inspiration
Finding a good spot on campus can be hard during peak study times, like midterms or finals. We thought a way to navigate suggestions from others would be useful.

## What it does
Allows for uploading a card and viewing all cards from a database. 

## How we built it
We used node.js, express.js, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB Atlas. 

## Challenges we ran into
We knew nothing coming into this project. We had to learn everything about networking, webpage design, front end and backend development, and interfacing across routes and with mongoose, our MongoDB driver.
We were also going to host this on my website but this turned out to be harder than expected with the software I was currently using.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having a running node project that doesn't look half bad.

## What we learned
Full stack development is really hard, even for a simple website.

## What's next for StudySpot
* Sorting by new, popular, personal favorites
Implies users on the website, which would be another hurdle for us :)
* Add aggregated ratings on existing cards
* Sort by location
* Better star backend
*Perhaps using a framework like React or Angular
